# Concentration

I made this game as a project for my Front-End Web Development Nanodegree from Udacity.

## How to play

When you click a card, it will flip over to display a symbol. If you flip over two that match, they will turn green and you can continue looking for another matching pair. If they do not match, they will flip back over. Find all matching pairs to win!

### Scoring

3 stars - 25 moves or less
2 stars - 26 to 35 moves
1 stars - 36 to 45 moves
0 stars - 46 or more moves

#### Getting started

In order to play this game, you can either clone the git project, or you can play it online at https://grantiverson.github.io/work/concentration/index.html
